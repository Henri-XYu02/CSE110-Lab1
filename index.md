## Programmer Introduction

I am ***Xinle Yu***, a second-year UCSD student studying MathCS. Frankly speaking, I am not that interested in **programming as a career** and I am more interested in absrtact theories like math and algorithms.

Therefore, my favorite quote is 
> Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form

I really don't know what code quotes to put here so I will put Tomohiko Sakamoto algorithm here, which is an elegant one to get the day.
```
dow(m,d,y){y-=m>3; return(y+y/4-y/100+y/400+"-bed=pen+mad."[m]+d)%7;}
```
My github username is [Henri-XYu02](https://github.com/Henri-XYu02), but I haven't done any project and posted anything remarkable on it yet.

Honestly, I feel nervous towards CSE110, just like [this guy](N.png).
